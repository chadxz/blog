This week was going to be a challenge. [AstriCon](http://www.asterisk.org/community/astricon-user-conference).

I don't usually get a lot of sleep during AstriCon, and I typically work my liver out more than any other part of my body. Not exactly the best set up for marathon training, particularly when one's training plan is based on cumulative fatigue. Going in, I came up with the following plan:

1. Get to bed early Monday night. I wouldn't get in until nearly midnight, which actually worked a little bit in my favor: less time to get pulled into whatever conference vortex was forming. I planned to move quickly through the hotel lobby and get to bed immediately.

2. Get my speedwork day in on Tuesday, as per plan. This was the first of the hard runs.

3. Move my Friday easy-ish day to Wednesday, as opposed to taking it off. I had an early flight out on Friday, and this way I didn't have to worry about running before the flight.

4. Suck it up enough to get up on Thursday. Wednesday night is usually the most active night, so this would be a challenge.

## Monday (5 miles easy)

I did my five miles easy downtown. A few hours at work, and it was off to the airport for an evening flight to Orlando. I had to wait for a few other folks once I landed. Combined with the taxi ride over, I didn't get to hotel until midnight, and fell asleep about 12:30.

No worries. Six hours of sleep is enough, right?

Here we go.

## Tuesday (5x1000m speed work)

The alarm went off at 6-ish. Groggy, I got myself up, out, and going.

As I got going, I noticed that it smelled a bit. Kind of sulfurish. I probably shouldn't have been surprised; Florida is kind of one big swamp. It was also hot and humid. Knew that the route was mostly a big square, figured I'd run to one of the far 'corners' and turn around. Out and back. Went fine until I saw the hill. WTF?

Sucking wind hard on the last interval, but did it. FU Floridia. You stink, literally.

## Wednesday (6 miles easy)

Ran with a group. Don't usually do that, enjoyable. Can see this would be a bit weird on a tempo day or other substance day, but easy days are great for group running. Had to remind them to slow down a bit, no faster than 9:40-ish please.

9:50 min/mile.

## Thursday (~~8 mile tempo~~ Sleep)

Guess what happened the night before?

Conference Matt. Conference Matt happened.

Really, it wasn't a lot of boozing, but way too much talking. Didn't get back up to the room until 12:30 or so, and wasn't really asleep until 1. When I woke, there was just no way. Could I have done it? Maybe, I wasn't hung over. But running after drinking with no sleep didn't sound very smart. I know, I can juggle it again - we'll run Friday evening when I get home. That still gives me Saturday for an easy run, with my long on Sunday. YAY.

This was not the best of plans.

## Friday (~~8 mile tempo~~ 6 mile tempo)

Plane trip back was uneventful. I don't like running in the evenings, but damnit, I was going to get all my runs in this week.

Talked to Katie.

"You know it's going to rain all weekend, right? I don't see you doing 15 miles on a treadmill on Sunday."

"Shit."

Stupid hurricane Nate.

If I moved the 15 mile run to Saturday morning, I should't do my tempo run. Or else I should cancel my long run. I didn't like either of those options, so I went with a compromise:
1. Drop the 8 mile tempo to a 6 mile tempo. Still a substance run, but slightly easier.
2. Do the 15 miles tomorrow, but don't set a 9:20 min/mile pace. Instead, do 5 at slow pace, 5 at long pace, and finish it up with 5 at slow pace.

Went and did the tempo run, did not enjoy it. How the F do people run in the evening? I had lunch people, and now it wanted to come back out. Maybe those burger sliders with chili weren't a great idea. Got it done with a solid ~8:32 min/mile pace for the speed work though. No pain.

## Saturday (15 mile long)

WHoooooooooooooooooooo boy.

Drove down to Whitesburg Elementary, started out in the dark. Going to do the loop of transcendence.

Even without the Garmin warning me, I quickly got up to long distance pace. What the hell, it isn't hurting. Kept it at that pace for the whole 15. Never had to stretch out the legs, which I had to do previously to keep the knee from hurting.

As an aside, pretty sure knee pain for me is from weak quads.

Finished well on it, 9:25 min/mile.

## Sunday (6 mile slow)

Hurricane Nate was a bit of a soggy mess. Lots of rain that seemed to alternate between sprinkling and spattering. The real stuff, with the wind, was still several hours away, and I hate treadmills. Running in the rain it is.

No big deal, finished at 9:44 min/mile.
