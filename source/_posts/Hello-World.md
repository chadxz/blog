Or rather, Hello World, again. Over the next few days I'm going to pull in some of my posts from my old WordPress site.

Rather than using a heavy weight blogging platform again, I've instead decided to go with [Hexo](https://hexo.io), a static site generator. Why?

1. Posts can be written in text in markdown. I vastly prefer this over yet another WYSIWYG HTML/RichText editor.

2. All of the site and the content can be managed using [Git](https://github.com/matt-jordan/blog).

3. Connecting and deploying the site is trivial using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Posts will be sporadic, as per usual.
